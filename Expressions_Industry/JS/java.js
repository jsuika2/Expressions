//  I drink a lot of sodas and coffee when working on web design projects. How much grams of sugar in a work week do I consume?
      // Going to add how many coffees and sodas I drink each day, figure out how much sugar consumed each day and then multiply that by days worked.

alert("Working long hours on web design projects sometimes requires a little caffeine or soda pick me up. ")

// We are going to enter how many cans of soda John drinks while at work
//   then we are gonna add to how many sodas Jill drinks daily



//var milkDrankJohn = prompt ("How many oz. does  drink daily?",10); //going to be the first part of the formula, add this to the girl's
//var milkDrankJill = prompt ("How many oz. does Jill drink daily?",20);
//var days          = prompt ("How many days are energy drink needed?",5);

//var total;

//total = ((myArray[0]+myArray[1]))* myArray[2] * myArray[3];   //does not work bt tried it;
