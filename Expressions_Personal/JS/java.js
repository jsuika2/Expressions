//var milkDrankJohn = prompt ("How many oz. does  drink daily?",10); //going to be the first part of the formula, add this to the girl's
//var milkDrankJill = prompt ("How many oz. does Jill drink daily?",20);
//var days          = prompt ("How many days are energy drink needed?",5);



//var myArray =new Array ();
//myArray[0] = milkDrankJohn;
//myArray[1] = milkDrankJill;
//myArray[2] =  days
//myArray[3] = .0625








//var total;

//total = ((myArray[0]+myArray[1]))* myArray[2] * myArray[3];   //does not work bt tried it;
